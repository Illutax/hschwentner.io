# Enforce Ubiquitous Language

![](../../images/domain-driven-refactorings/tactical/enforce-ubiquitous-language.drawio.svg)

## Motivation

Whenever the code uses bad names, obscure technical names, strange abbreviations, or names that do not reflect your current understanding of the domain—change them accordingly. DDD calls this philosophy “Refactoring Towards Deeper Insight.”

## Mechanics

- When the code uses the wrong words apply *Rename Class*, *Rename Method* and the like.
- Change the user interface accordingly.

## Example(s)
