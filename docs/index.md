Hi, my name's Henning and I help to solve your software development problems.

## Consulting

You want to understand Domain-Driven Design?
Or you have a monolith/big ball of mud/legacy software you want to split?
Or you're building software from scratch and don't know how?

Give me a call or write an [e-mail](hs@wps.de)!

## Training/Speaking

I regularly give talks and workshops on international conferences.
You can also hire me for in-house trainings at your company.
This ranges from a one hour inspirational talk to a [three day training course]() including many practical exercises.

Topics include Domain-Driven Design, microservices, monolith splitting, Collaborative Modeling, and software architecture and development in general.

## Writing

### Text

Stefan Hofer and I have written a book. It's called *Domain Storytelling* and shows how to understand your users by drawing pictures.

Also, I sometimes write magazine or blog  articles.
Some of them are: XXX
