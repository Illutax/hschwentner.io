## Motivation

A legacy system is full of domain knowledge that is probably documented nowhere else. Sometimes thereâ€™s is even no more domain expert who has this knowledge. To save that knowledge into the modern world, transform it into a new bounded context.

## Mechanics

- Analyze the domain to find out which bounded contexts should be there.
- Identify first carve-out candidate
- Apply the *Tactical 4 Strategic* refactorings that are right for your situation.

## Example(s)
